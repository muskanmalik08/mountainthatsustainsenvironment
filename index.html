        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <h4 class="text">
            The word Himalaya comes from two Sanskrit words: Him (snow) and Aalay (abode). The beauty of the Himalaya,
            which are one of the youngest chains of mountains in the world harbouring a diverse ecosystem, lies in its
            intriguing complexity. The region is among the 36 world biodiversity hotspots. According to a report by the
            International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development, the region encompassing the Hindu Kush Himalaya
            encompasses 240 million people.

        <h2>Several challenges</h2>
        <h4 class="text">
            The mountains are the most resilient; yet, ironically, their inhabitants are vulnerable. With few livelihood
            options, forests form an essential life support system for the locals. However, dwindling natural resources,
            unsustainable agricultural practices, lack of basic amenities and so on create a challenge for local
            sustenance. Demographic shifts, weak institutional capacity, poor infrastructure, and a paucity of adequate
            information on mountain-specific climate change pose challenges to capacity-building in the region.

            Studies have revealed low food availability and decreased self-sufficiency owing to the combined pressures
            of increasing wildlife attacks on crops and livestock and persistent youth out-migration. An increase in
            male out-migration has put the brunt of household responsibility on the women and the elderly, who tend to
            focus more labour on livestock production, often to the neglect of crop agriculture, further rendering the
            land unproductive and prone to wildlife foraging. Lack of irrigation sources and drying up of local gadhera
            (small river tributaries), dhara (spring), naula (aquifer) etc. amidst uneven precipitation and erratic
            rainfall have added to the water woes of the hills. With traditional crops being replaced by cash crops,
            agro-biodiversity of the region has declined and dietary patterns have altered. This has increased
            nutritional insecurity, and undermined long-term agricultural sustainability in the region.

            In the light of such events, what is the role of the government, policymakers, locals and outsiders?
            Mountain-specific policies to strengthen livelihood opportunities based on both farm and non-farm activities
            should be developed. Organic farming methods like use of biopesticides and botanicals and bio-composting
            should be promoted. Local food systems need to be revived and niche products of the mountain need to be
            developed. Marketing systems and infrastructure need to be strengthened. Healthy livestock management
            practices should be explored and the potential of medicinal plants harnessed. Region-specific water security
            and cleaner energy solutions should be sought by bringing key stakeholders in a synergistic partnership. In
            all this, people’s role, especially that of the women, should not be ignored. As custodians of important
            traditional knowledge on preparation of seeds, harvesting, the medicinal use of plant species, etc., their
            inclusion in policymaking and the decision-making process becomes all the more crucial.

        <h2>Sacred and Sublime</h2>
        <h4 class="text">
            In 2014, the Uttarakhand government declared September 9 as Himalaya Diwas to spread the message of
            conservation of the Himalayan ecosystems. For those living in the mountain ranges, the word ‘Himalaya’ might
            not be what they associate themselves with. For them, it is their pahad (mountain), jal (water), jungle,
            jameen (land), jeev-jantu (living beings), jadi-booti (roots and herbs), roji-roti (daily earnings). We as
            outsiders have dissociated the mountains from the people, the people from the resources, the resources from
            their livelihood.

            As we come across Himalaya Diwas posters and policy framework documents being released, rallies being
            carried out and slogans of ‘Himalaya Bachao’ lost amid the grunting of JCB excavators, we should take a
            moment to reflect on the importance of the mountain system in its entirety. As author Stephen Alter put it,
            we need to view the Himalaya as both the sacred and the sublime.
